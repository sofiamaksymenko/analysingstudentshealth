# Mental Health Analysis of International Students Using SQL

## Description
This project analyzes survey data from international students at a Japanese university using PostgreSQL to examine the impact of studying abroad on mental health. The focus is on how social connectedness, acculturative stress, and length of stay influence depression levels.

The goal is to validate existing research suggesting that international students face greater mental health risks and to uncover key factors contributing to depression during cultural adjustment.

## Objectives
- Analyze depression levels among international students
- Identify the relationship between social connectedness, acculturative stress, and depression
- Evaluate whether the length of stay in a foreign country influences mental health outcomes

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL  
- DataCamp Datalab  

## Data Source
- Survey data collected in 2018 from international students at a Japanese university
- Ethically approved and anonymized for analysis

## Key Insights
- Higher depression levels: International students showed increased depression levels compared to the general population.
- Social connectedness matters: Students with low social connectedness reported significantly higher depression scores.
- Acculturative stress is a key predictor: High levels of stress from adapting to a new culture are strongly linked to depression.
- Length of stay effects: Longer stays were sometimes associated with better adaptation and lower stress levels, suggesting a moderating effect over time.
